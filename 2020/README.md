[:link:](data/01.txt) Puzzle Input

### Part One:
Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up. Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

***Answer: 691,771***

### Part Two:
The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?

## Day 2: Password Philosophy

[:globe_with_meridians:](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2) Puzzle Details

[:link:](data/02.txt) Puzzle Input

### Part One:
Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

How many passwords are valid according to their policies?

***Answer: 586***

### Part Two:
Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on. (Be careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!) Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement.

How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?

***Answer: 352***
